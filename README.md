# Conway's Game of Life

See [page](https://tlgs.github.io/life).

Implementation of Conway's Game of Life using vanilla JavaScript
and the HTML `<canvas>` API.

The focus of the application in on the world engine and not its graphical
representation; expect no extra _flavorful_ features.
The initial world state is random - refresh the page to generate a new one.

Inspired by
[Jack Diederich's 2012 PyCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0).
