# Conway's Game of Life

Inspired by
[Jack Diederich's 2012 PyCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0).

This is a refactor of a previous Python solution
using vanilla JavaScript and the `<canvas>` HTML API.

The initial configuration is random.

Underlying solution represents a cell's coordinates as a single integer;
this imposes a limit on the range of usable values.
